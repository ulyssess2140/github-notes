### Git - Git is a software used for locating any changes in a specific file. In shorter terms it is a version control system that allows the user to keep track of source code history.


### Github - Github is a platform for version control and collaberation. It also allows for group work with others on projects.


### Repo - Software repository or "repo" for short is basically a storage location for software packages which is usually managed by source control.


### Commit - With version control systems comes the commit. The commit is an operation that sends the latest source code to the repo. Version control can allow a rollback to the previous versions before the commit.
